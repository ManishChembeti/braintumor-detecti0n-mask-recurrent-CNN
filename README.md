# braintumor-detecti0n-mask-recurrent-CNN
This project is aimed at detection of brain tumor from MRI Scan using Mask R-CNN Architecture which is the state-of-the-art architecture for object detection and object classification. It is an instance segmentation technique which automatically segments the image and generates pixel-wise masks for every input image. Along with that, Class label and bounding box is also given as an output. In this project, first steps have been taken to transfer learn the pre-trained Mask R-CNN Model on COCO dataset to the dataset consisting of brain MRI Scans.
